# InJavE-2D
A 2D Game Engine Written In Java using the LWJGL library (REWRITE)

## Requirements
**JDK 11** is required. If you don't have it you can download it from here: https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot
To make sure that you are using the correct version of **JDK** open your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** and type: ***java -version***, and if it says something like
***OpenJDK version 11.x.x*** you are good to go.

## How to edit
Load this as a project in **IntelliJ IDEA** (if it works you can use **eclipse** as well (or any IDE for that matter)).

## Building the project
Build the project with all dependecies using a build artifact in IntelliJ IDEA (dependecies required by Jar).

## Using the engine
You can add your own ***scripts*** and ***assets*** and you can also edit the ***source*** (working on proper documentation soon).
